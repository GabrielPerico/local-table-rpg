# What is this?

This is a project for a Tabletop RPG controller, where you can manage your characters, items, and other stuff.

This is a place where you can see your enemies during combat, and see the stats of your characters.

It will be an local server, so its designed to be an offline app, and used during LAN parties.

Checklist:

- [ ] Create a base design for the app
- [ ] Create a database schema (this will be an SQLite database to be used in any devices)
